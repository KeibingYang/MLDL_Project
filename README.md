# MLDL_Project
The repository is the project belonged to Kaibing Yang and its theme is about finetuning the multimodal model to adpat specific task. Specically, the project finetunes the Florence-2 modle to better address the DocVQA problem.

In this project, we explored the related work of DocVQA and fine-tuned it on DocVQA2020 based on Florence-2 with satisfactory results

# Dataset
For the fine-tuned dataset, we mainly used the DocVQA2020 dataset(https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/DocVQA)

# Model
For model selection, we chose the Florence-2 model due to the consideration of computational resources(https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-base-ft/tree/main)

# Result
